\chapter{Clause Types and Speech Acts in English}%
\label{appx:engcl}

Three logistic regression models with each of the clause type as the dependent variable and the 8 morpho-syntactic features (the presence/absence of verbs and unknown functional item at preverbal position were excluded due to extremely low variance) as independent variables were performed, and the results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:engcl:real-synstats}:
