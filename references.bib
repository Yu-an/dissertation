	abstract = {Abstract Recent research on children's acquisition of prosody, or the rhythm and melody in language, demonstrates that young children use prosody in their comprehension and production of utterances to a greater extent than was previously documented. Spoken language, structured by prosodic form, is the primary input on which the mental representations and processes that comprise language use are built. Understanding how children acquire prosody and develop the mapping between prosody and other aspects of language is crucial to any effort to model the role of prosody in the processing system. We focus on two aspects of prosody that have been shown to play a primary role in its use as an organizational device in human languages, prosodic phrasal grouping, and intonational prominence.},

@article{shukla2011,
	abstract = {Human infants are predisposed to rapidly acquire their native language. The nature of these predispositions is poorly understood, but is crucial to our understanding of how infants unpack their speech input to recover the fundamental word-like units, assign them referential roles, and acquire the rules that govern their organization. Previous researchers have demonstrated the role of general distributional computations in prelinguistic infants{\textquoteright} parsing of continuous speech. We extend these findings to more naturalistic conditions, and find that 6-mo-old infants can simultaneously segment a nonce auditory word form from prosodically organized continuous speech and associate it to a visual referent. Crucially, however, this mapping occurs only when the word form is aligned with a prosodic phrase boundary. Our findings suggest that infants are predisposed very early in life to hypothesize that words are aligned with prosodic phrase boundaries, thus facilitating the word learning process. Further, and somewhat paradoxically, we observed successful learning in a more complex context than previously studied, suggesting that learning is enhanced when the language input is well matched to the learner{\textquoteright}s expectations.},

It is therefore a catalyst for their ability to learn from others. However, despite its importance for cognitive developmental theorizing and its implications for educational practice, relative to other aspects of children's exploratory behavior, research on children's questions has been relatively sparse and siloed across several disciplines. The aim of this review is to provide a framework for organizing past and future research on question-asking and to use this framework to describe what development and variability in children's question asking looks like between infancy and the elementary school years. We propose that question-asking can be divided into four components: (1) initiation, (2) formulation, (3) expression, and (4) response evaluation and follow-up. Drawing on research from the fields of psychology, education, and developmental psycholinguistics we review what is known and not known about these four components between infancy and elementary school as well as describe sources of variability across development.},

Forty-nine 18-month-old infants were exposed to a speaker who either accurately or inaccurately labeled familiar objects. Subsequently, the speaker administered a series of tasks in which infants had an opportunity to: learn a novel word, imitate the speaker's 'irrational' actions, and help the speaker obtain an out-of-reach object. In contrast to infants in the accurate (reliable) condition, those in the inaccurate (unreliable) condition performed more poorly on a word-learning task and were less likely to imitate. All infants demonstrated high rates of instrumental helping behavior. These results are the first to demonstrate that infants as young as 18 months of age cannot only detect a speaker's verbal inaccuracy but also use this information to attenuate their word recognition and learning of novel actions.

Other people, however, are not always reliable sources of knowledge. People can be ignorant, hold false beliefs, or simply be deceptive. How do children evaluate the reliability of sources of knowledge for word learning? This chapter investigates the possibility that children possess multiple mechanisms for evaluating such reliability and possess such mechanisms very early in development. We suggest that infants not only track the accuracy of others using statistical learning mechanisms but also incorporate their existing knowledge of the world into judgments of reliability to make judicious inferences about the knowledge of a speaker and the pragmatics of a communicative act. Moreover, we suggest that as children get older, both low-level associative mechanisms and higher-level cognitive processes influence the way in which children track and use others' reliability as sources of knowledge.},

	abstract = {Infants show interesting patterns of flexibility and constraint early in word learning. Here, we explore perceptual and experiential factors that drive associative learning of labels that differ in pitch contour. Contrary to the salience hypothesis proposed in Experiment 1, English-learning 14-month-olds failed to map acoustically distinctive level and dipping labels to novel referents, even though they discriminated the labels when no potential referents were present. Conversely, infants readily mapped the less distinctive rising and dipping labels. In Experiment 2, we found that the degree of pitch variation in labels also does not account for learning. Instead, English-learning infants only learned if one of the labels had a rising pitch contour. We argue that experience with hearing and/or producing native language prosody may lead infants to initially over-interpret the role rising pitch plays in differentiating words. Together, our findings suggest that multiple factors contribute to whether specific acoustic forms will function as candidate object labels.},

Previous studies into the acquisition of prosodic categories have focused on lexical stress, lexical pitch accent, or lexical tone. However, very little is known about the developmental course of infants' perception of linguistic intonation. In this study, we investigate infants' perception of the correlates of the statement/yes--no question contrast in a language that marks this sentence type distinction only by prosodic means, European Portuguese (EP). Using a modified version of the visual habituation paradigm, EP-learning infants at 5--6 and 8--9 months were able to successfully discriminate segmentally varied, single-prosodic word intonational phrases presented with statement or yes--no question intonation, demonstrating that they are sensitive to the prosodic cues marking this distinction as early as 5 months and maintain this sensitivity throughout the first year. These results suggest the presence of precocious discrimination abilities for intonation across segmental variation, similarly to previous reports for lexical pitch accent, but unlike previous findings for word stress.},

	abstract = {When young children answer questions, they do so more slowly than adults and appear to have difficulty finding the appropriate words. Because children leave gaps before they respond, it is possible that they could answer faster with gestures than with words. In this study, we compare gestural and verbal responses from one child between the ages of 1;4 and 3;5, to adult Where and Which questions, which can be answered with gestures and/or words. After extracting all adult Where and Which questions and child answers from longitudinal videotaped sessions, we examined the timing from the end of each question to the start of the response, and compared the timing for gestures and words. Child responses could take the form of a gesture or word(s); the latter could be words repeated from the adult question or new words retrieved by the child. Or responses could be complex: a gesture + word repeat, gesture + new word, or word repeat + new word. Gestures were the fastest overall, followed successively by word-repeats, then new-word responses. This ordering, with gestures ahead of words, suggests that the child knows what to answer but needs more time to retrieve any relevant words. In short, word retrieval and articulation appear to be bottlenecks in the timing of responses: both add to the planning required in answering a question.},

In two eye-tracking experiments, we measured children's anticipatory gaze to upcoming responders while controlling linguistic cues to turn structure. In Experiment 1, we showed English and non-English conversations to English-speaking adults and children. In Experiment 2, we phonetically controlled lexicosyntactic and prosodic cues in English-only speech. Children spontaneously made anticipatory gaze switches by age two and continued improving through age six. In both experiments, children and adults made more anticipatory switches after hearing questions. Consistent with prior findings on adult turn prediction, prosodic information alone did not increase children's anticipatory gaze shifts. But, unlike prior work with adults, lexical information alone was not sufficient either---children's performance was best overall with lexicosyntax and prosody together. Our findings support an account in which turn tracking and turn prediction emerge in infancy and then gradually become integrated with children's online linguistic processing.},

We tracked participants' anticipatory eye movements as they watched videos of dyadic puppet conversation. We controlled the prosodic and lexicosyntactic cues to turn completion for a subset of the utterances in each conversation to create four types of target utterances (fully incomplete, incomplete syntax, incomplete prosody, and fully complete). All participants (Dutch and English toddlers and adults) used both prosodic and lexicosyntactic cues to anticipate upcoming speaker changes, but weighed lexicosyntactic cues over prosodic ones when the two were pitted against each other. The results suggest that Dutch and English toddlers are already nearly adult-like in their use of prosodic and lexicosyntactic cues in anticipating upcoming turn transitions.},

Children and mothers from ethnically diverse backgrounds (African American, Dominican and Mexican) were video-recorded sharing the wordless book `Frog, Where are You?' when children were three, four and five years of age. Mothers' questions were coded as referential (e.g. `What's that?'), story-specific (e.g. `Where is the boy looking for the frog?') and open-ended (e.g. `What will happen next?'). Mothers decreased their use of referential questions between the child ages of four and five in both frequency and proportion. Story-specific questions increased in frequency and proportion with increasing child age. Open-ended questions decreased in frequency between the child ages of four and five and did not change in proportion over time. Mothers' question types related to children's narrative contributions concurrently and over time. },

The participants were 177 2-to 6-year old native speakers of Persian who were asked both positively and negatively formulated yes--no questions about eight household objects. The results showed that children of different ages are influenced differently by the way questions are formulated. The findings also suggest that children display a compliance tendency when asked yes--no questions. That is, they tend to respond to yes--no questions in the direction implied by the question: `yes' to positively worded questions and `no' to negatively worded questions. This tendency, however, seems to grow weaker as children get older. Copyright {\copyright} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

To support this interpretation, four arguments are offered. It is shown that the interpretation of commom question words as the existential quantifier can help explain not only the relation between yes-no questions and their negative replies but also the connection between rhetorical questions and their conversationally implied meanings. 本文认为疑问句里的疑问词与语当作虚指词的疑问词皆可解释为存在量词。我们从1. 特指限制，2. 共存限制， 3. 量词范围的歧义来证明这种解释是可行的。我们最后说明这种解释如何能帮助我们了解疑问句与回答之间的关系，以及反问句与它们所欲传达的意义之间的关系。},

The sample comprised 168 2-to 6-year-old children, who were asked a set of yes/no questions about eight everyday objects. The results showed that children of different ages are influenced differently by the question format. The findings suggest that yes/no questions carry some suggestibility load and impose some restrictions upon children's responses. The influence of yes/no questions seems to grow weaker as children develop. Nevertheless, the use of such questions may affect task outcomes, especially when used with younger children. },

The data contributes to our understanding of the young child's responses to pauses and highlights the need for empirical validation of discourse segmentation procedures.},

The three are similar in that they seem to render the assertion expressed by the attached declarative tentative in some way. The differences among them are brought out especially clearly in dialogues with taste predicates (tasty, attractive) and vague scalar predicates applied to borderline cases (red for an orange-red object). These differences have consequences for the correct model of conversation, common ground, and speech acts. Our proposal involves a conversational `scoreboard' that allows speakers to make strong or tentative commitments, propose changes or raise expectations about the Common Ground, propose issues to be resolved, and hazard guesses about other participants' beliefs. This model allows for distinctions among speech acts that are subtle and fine-grained enough to account for the behavior of these three markers.}},

	abstract = {Certain measurement-related constructions impose a requirement that the measure function used track the part-whole structure of the domain of measurement, so that a given entity or eventuality must have a larger measurement in the chosen dimension than any of its salient proper parts. I provide evidence from English and Chinese that these constructions can be used to measure the intensity of mental states like hatred and love, indicating that in the natural language ontology of such states, intensity correlates with part-whole structure. A natural language metaphysics of psychological intensity meeting this requirement is then developed and integrated into the semantics. Further complications arise when looking at attitudes like want, wish, and regret, which also permit measurements of intensity in the relevant constructions. To account for such attitudes, the ontology and semantics are then enriched in a way that integrates ordering and quantification over possible worlds into the part-whole structure of attitude states, so that even in these more complicated cases, the constructions at hand have a unified compositional semantics.},

We argue that one of the major reasons to think that possibility modals can be graded, namely the appearance of German possibility modals like m{\"o}glich `possible' and kann `can' in a special comparative construction involving eher, does not withstand closer scrutiny. We argue that eher is not a simple comparative marker and propose an analysis of eher m{\"o}glich in which degrees of epistemic commitment are compared, not degrees of possibility. Our analysis explains similarities between eher and epistemic modals in terms of individual orientation, inference, and interaction with attitude predicates. Certain striking similarities between eher and metalinguistic comparatives are discussed, with notable differences in modality type and distribution arguing against the conflation of these two constructions and contributing to a deeper understanding of special comparative constructions across languages.}},

	abstract = {Crosslinguistically, the same modal words can be used to express a wide range of interpretations. This crosslinguistic trend supports a Kratzerian analysis, where each modal has a core lexical entry and where the difference between an epistemic and a root interpretation is contextually determined. A long-standing problem for such a unified account is the equally robust crosslinguistic correlation between a modal's interpretation and its syntactic behavior: epistemics scope high (in particular higher than tense and aspect) and roots low, a fact which has led to proposals that hardwire different syntactic positions for epistemics and roots (cf. Cinque's hierarchy). This paper argues that the range of interpretations a modal receives is even more restricted: a modal must be keyed to certain time-individual pairs, but not others. I show that this can be captured straightforwardly by minimally modifying the Kratzerian account: modals are relative to an event---rather than a world---of evaluation, which readily provides a time (the event's running time) and (an) individual(s) (the event's participants). I propose that this event relativity of modals can in turn explain the correlation between type of interpretation and syntactic position, without stipulation of an interpretation-specific height for modals.},

	abstract = {In the philosophy of logic a distinction is often made between the theory of reference and the theory of meaning.1 In this paper I shall suggest (inter alia) that this distinction, though not without substance, is profoundly misleading. The theory of reference is, I shall argue, the theory of meaning for certain simple types of language. The only entities needed in the so-called theory of meaning are, in many interesting cases and perhaps even in all cases, merely what is required in order for the expressions of our language to be able to refer in certain more complicated situations. Instead of the theory of reference and the theory of meaning we perhaps ought to speak in some cases of the theory of simple and of multiple reference, respectively. Quine has regretted that the term `semantics', which etymologically ought to refer to the theory of meaning, has come to mean the theory of reference.1 I submit that this usage is happier than Quine thinks, and that large parts of the theory of meaning in reality are --- or ought to be --- but semantical theories for notions transcending the range of certain elementary types of concepts.},

Are these differences simply differences in timing, or do they represent different patterns of cultural learning? That is, to what extent are sequences of theory-of-mind understanding universal, and to what extent are they culture-specific? We addressed these questions by using a theory-of-mind scale to examine performance of 140 Chinese children living in Beijing and to compare their performance with that of 135 English-speaking children living in the United States and Australia. Results reveal a common sequence of understanding, as well as sociocultural differences in children's developing theories of mind. },

	abstract = {Abstract This study examined how the semantic meanings of rational numbers embodied in graphical representations pose a constraint on children's construction of the concept of fraction equivalence. A test consisting of graphical representations representing the part--whole and measuring semantic meaning was given to 205 fifth-graders and 208 sixth-graders from China. Results showed that the fifth-graders' overall performance on equivalent fraction items was poor across the semantic domains of rational numbers. The sixth-graders showed significantly improved performance on the equivalent fraction items representing the part--whole relation but not on those representing the measure aspect of rational number. The results provide evidence that semantic meanings of fractional numbers in different relevant contexts also constitute a source of difficulty in children's constructing the concept of fraction equivalence, in addition to the multiplicative nature of the concept.},
